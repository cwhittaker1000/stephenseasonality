# stephenseasonality - Seasonality and Dynamics of Anopheles stephensi üåèüìàü¶ü

## Overview
This repository contains the code used to analyse the results of a systematic review exploring the temporal dynamics and seasonality of Anopheles stephensi populations across Afghanistan, Djibouti, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 

Along with references from previously published work detailing Anopheles stephensi occurrence data (Sinke et al., 2020, PNAS: https://www.pnas.org/content/117/40/24900), a systematic review was carried out to identify entomological surveys in which collections of Anopheles stephensi had been conducted monthly (or finer resolution) over a period of at least 10 months. The collated entomological data was then analysed using a Bayesian Gaussian Process based approach in order to characterise the temporal patterns and seasonality displayed by these different populations. This work is not yet published, but methodologically is based on "The Ecological Structure of Mosquito Population Seasonal Dynamics", available here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.09.21249456v2.
